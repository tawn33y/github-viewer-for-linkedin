# Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 21, 2021

This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy”) explains how Github Viewer for LinkedIn (GVFL, "we”, "us", or "our") collects and processes information from members and users of the extension for web browsers (the "Extension”).

If we ever need additional personal information for a specific reason, we will tell you and ask for your permission. Also, to the extent that GVFL has links to other websites, please note that we do not own, operate, or control them, and they have their own controlling privacy policies that you should review.

By using the Extension, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.

## What data we collect and why

In order to provide our products, GVFL collects information that you share directly with us when you use the Extension. GVFL also collects technical information about your device and use of GVFL to make sure that the Extension is working correctly. The information we collect is geared to providing GVFL members with a better way to use the Extension and to help us develop, improve, and market our services.

### Account and Profile Information

To retrieve Github profile data, we collect the following personal data from your LinkedIn page:

* Github username
* Github url
* First name and last name

### Technical Information

GVFL automatically collects information to ensure that our products work correctly on different devices and browsers. This may include, but is not limited to, data like:

* the type of device you're using
* the device's unique ID (where available)
* operating system
* browser type/version
* IP address
* event stamp
* error logs

This data allows us to make sure GVFL products are working correctly, to make your experience better, and to detect and prevent fraud.

GVFL does not track your search engine history, emails, or your browsing on any site that is not a LinkedIn user's page.

### Aggregate and Anonymized Data

We may also use the information we collect in aggregate or otherwise anonymized form. This lets us look at interactions with our site and products generally and does not identify you or any specific person. We use this general data for research, development, marketing, analytics, and to enhance the experience for the GVFL community.

### Links to other websites

GVFL may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

## What data we do not collect

GVFL does not track your search engine history, emails, or your browsing on any site that is not a LinkedIn user's page.

## How we share your data

We know how important your personal data is to you, so we will never sell it. We'll only share it with your consent or in ways you'd expect (as we explain here).

We may also share information in the following cases:

* with your express consent;
* in an aggregate or anonymized format that does not identify any specific person;
* as required by law, or to comply or respond to a valid government request;
* when we believe in good faith that it's necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud; and
* with a buyer or successor if GVFL is involved in a merger, acquisition, or similar corporate transaction. If that happens, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Extension of any change in ownership, as well as any choices you will have as a result.

## How we protect your data

The security of your information is important to us. We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data.

These measures include limiting access, using encryption, testing for vulnerabilities, employing pseudonymization and anonymization techniques, and more.

Though we hate to say it, despite our efforts, we can't guarantee that user information will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed as a result of a breach of any of our safeguards. You provide us with information at your own risk.

GVFL only retains information about you as long as you keep using GVFL, though we’ll keep information if we need it to meet our legal obligations and to defend against legal claims.

## Retention of your data

GVFL will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your personal data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

GVFL will also retain Technical Data for internal analysis purposes. Technical Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of GVFL, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

## How we use cookies and similar technologies

Like most other online services, GVFL may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other markers (we'll just call them "cookies”) to collect some of the data discussed in this Privacy Policy. These help us operate our products, analyze engagement and usage, and provide a relevant and personalized experience. See below to learn how you can manage your cookie preferences.

Some cookies can be temporary ("session cookies” like those used for navigating your browser) and disappear once you close it. Others last longer ("persistent cookies,” like when you ask a site to remember your login) and are saved to your computer until you delete them.

Our uses of cookies and similar technologies fall into the following general categories:

* **Essential**: We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of the Extension. This includes technologies that allow you access to the Extension; that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions;
* **Performance**: We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of the Extension, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use the Extension, or to improve the Extension;
* **Functionality**: We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using the Extension. This may include keeping track of your specified preferences or interests so that we may enhance the presentation of content on the Extension;
* **Marketing**: We may use first-party or third-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on the Extension or on third party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that have been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.

Any personal information that we collect and store through use of these technologies for categories 2 through 4 above are based on your consent, obtained through a conspicuous disclosure on the Extension during your first visit. You can withdraw this consent in your account settings. If you want to disable cookies entirely, your browser or mobile device might have an option to do that. For more information, including instructions on disabling cookies, please visit: [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

## Your choices for managing your data

We've made it easy to opt out of GVFL's extension at any time.

If you want to stop using GVFL, you can uninstall the Extension in the same way you would uninstall other extensions from your browser.

If you would like to delete your profile or personal information, you can always reach out to us. We will delete any personal information we have, although the following exceptions apply: (1) we may still store your personal information if we need it to meet our legal or compliance obligations and/or to defend against legal claims; and (2) we may also continue to store your personal data in an aggregated and anonymized format that doesn’t identify you and can’t be attributed to you, even after you’ve deleted your profile.

## Transfer of your data

Your information, including personal data, is processed at GVFL's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents Your agreement to that transfer.

GVFL will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your personal data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.
